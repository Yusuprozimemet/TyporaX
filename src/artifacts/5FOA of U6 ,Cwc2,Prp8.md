I did transformations. 

Note: when you make many transformations at the same time, it's better to make PEG+plasmid mixture first, then centrifuge 30ul cells, get rid of LiOAc  and at the top of that you can add PEG+plasmid mix.

after two days, on yMK20 grew fungi, therefore, I repeated this plate and on these four plates I didn't see anything. therefore, I will wait them grow.   tomorrow I am planning to store, rest of the NICE plates in the fridge. and

I repeated the inefficient transformations and I leave the other transformations in the fridge for the use of 5FOA.

**Magda:** I think the last result (5FOA) clearly indicates that **U6-AT45,6ga stabilizes first step interactions even in the absence of the reporter - that is may be it stabilizes some endogenous introns critical for viability, or affects other interactions at the catalytic center, but we cannot simply argue that its effects are due to stabilization of ACT1CUP1.** That 5FOA result could/should be made into a proper figure - with appropriate controls (e.g. wt U6, U6-AT45,6ga, C43u, A42g, … what else?). It should also be good to have its combinations with cwc2 wt and mutants and Prp8 wt, 1st and 2nd step alleles - or even add these new alleles used in the current paper.. I am not sure yet what would we conclude from all this, but it seems important. These 5FOA results should also be tested at different temps. - perhaps wait for the newer transformations of strains with U6-AT45,6ga with cwc2 and prp8 alleles and then spot them on 5FOA together.
