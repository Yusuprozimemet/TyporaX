### Frontend Structure

1. **HTML Templates**: Create HTML templates using Flask's Jinja2 template engine. Define layouts for different sections of your application such as header, main editor area, sidebar, and footer.

2. **CSS Styling**: Use CSS to style your HTML templates and create a responsive layout. You can use frameworks like Bootstrap for easier styling if needed.

### Backend Structure

1. **Flask Application Setup**:
   - Set up a Flask project with routes to render your HTML templates and handle backend logic.

2. **Markdown Parsing**:
   - Use a Python library like `markdown2` or `mistune` to convert markdown syntax to HTML on the server side.

3. **File Management**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for managing markdown files on the server.
   - Store files securely on the server's file system or a database.

4. **Authentication** (if needed):
   - Implement user registration, login/logout functionality using Flask's session management or Flask-Login.

5. **Settings Management**:
   - Allow users to customize editor preferences (e.g., theme, font size) and save these settings on the server.

### Functionalities to Implement

1. **Markdown Editor**:
   - Create a textarea in your HTML form for markdown input.
   - Use server-side rendering to convert markdown to HTML and display it in another section of the HTML template.

2. **File Management**:
   - Create a file explorer sidebar using links or buttons to perform CRUD operations on markdown files.
   - Implement backend routes to handle file operations (create, read, update, delete).

3. **Settings**:
   - Implement forms or buttons in the HTML templates to allow users to adjust editor settings.
   - Use Flask to store these settings in the backend (e.g., in a database or session).

4. **Export/Import**:
   - Provide buttons or links in the UI to allow users to export markdown documents as `.md` files.
   - Implement a file upload mechanism if users want to import existing markdown files into the application.

### Example Workflow

- **User Interface**: Design an intuitive interface using HTML and CSS. Include sections for markdown input, live preview (server-rendered), file management, and settings customization.

- **Backend Logic**: Define Flask routes to handle form submissions, file operations, and settings updates. Use Flaskâ€™s session management or a database to store user-specific data and settings.

- **Security Considerations**: Ensure secure file handling and user authentication if dealing with sensitive data.

### Technologies to Use

- **Flask**: Lightweight backend framework for Python.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling.
- **Python Libraries**: Use libraries like `markdown2` or `mistune` for markdown parsing.
- **Database/Storage**: SQLite (for simplicity) or PostgreSQL (for more robust storage) for storing user data and preferences.

### Next Steps

1. **Project Setup**: Initialize your Flask project, set up virtual environment, and install necessary libraries like Flask and markdown parsing libraries.

2. **Frontend Development**: Create HTML templates using Flask's Jinja2 templating engine. Style them using CSS for a polished UI.

3. **Backend Development**: Define Flask routes to handle form submissions, implement CRUD operations for files, integrate markdown parsing, and manage user sessions (if required).

4. **Testing and Deployment**: Test your application locally to ensure it functions as expected. Deploy it on a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS once ready.

By focusing on server-side rendering and traditional form submissions within Flask, you can build a functional markdown editor web application without relying on JavaScript. This approach keeps your application simple and manageable while leveraging the capabilities of Flask and Python libraries.
