# TyporaX

## Why TyporaX?

I’ve always been a fan of Typora for writing simple lab notes filled with photos—it’s an amazing experience! However, I wished Typora had a Grammarly-like function to correct my English. So, I decided to create TyporaX. 

In TyporaX, I’ve included a sidebar similar to Typora’s, where you can view and search for files using keywords. Additionally, I’ve integrated Uyghur and Chinese language support into the editor.

You can even drop images directly into the markdown editor! To address my need for grammar correction, I’ve utilized the ChatGPT API. You can use it to correct grammar, ask questions about your text, summarize it, and format markdown for various files.

Images can be resized easily:

<img src="Screenshot_2347.png" alt="Image" style="width:50%;">

Adjust the size by changing the percentage width. For centering an image:

<p align="center">
<img src="Screenshot_2347.png" alt="Image" style="width:20%;">
</p>

For those who prefer dark mode, TyporaX offers both dark and light themes. If you have any questions or need help, click "Contact" in the Help menu or submit an issue on GitHub. I’ve also added shortcuts for saving, deleting, renaming, and creating files (Ctrl+X, R, D, Q), which can save you time. As a web app, TyporaX supports Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V for copy-pasting. Markdown preview is available with "Toggle Preview," and the Grammarly feature is sure to make you happy. 

Remember to register and log in to keep your privacy intact. TyporaX is perfect for writing diaries and preserving your memories. I plan to continue developing TyporaX and adding new features based on user feedback. Enjoy using TyporaX!
