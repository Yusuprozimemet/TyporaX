# TyporaX

Creating a web application similar to Typora, which is a markdown editor with a live preview, involves several components. Here's a basic structure and components you might consider:

### Frontend Structure

1. **UI Layout**
   - **Header:** Contains app title, navigation, and possibly user/account controls.
   - **Main Editor Area:** 
     - **Markdown Editor:** Text area where users can input markdown syntax.
     - **Live Preview:** Area where the rendered HTML from markdown is displayed in real-time.
   - **Sidebar:** 
     - **File Explorer:** Allows users to manage files and folders.
     - **Settings:** Options to customize editor behavior (e.g., theme, font size).
   - **Footer:** Optional; could include additional links or information.

2. **Technologies:**
   - **Frontend Framework:** Use a framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular for building dynamic interfaces.
   - **Styling:** CSS (possibly with pre-processors like Sass or Less) for styling components.
   - **Markdown Rendering:** Use a library like `marked.js` or `markdown-it` for converting markdown to HTML for live preview.

### Backend Structure (Optional, Depending on Features)

1. **Authentication (if needed):**
   - User registration, login/logout functionality.

2. **Storage:**
   - Store user files (markdown documents) securely.

3. **APIs (if applicable):**
   - Implement APIs for file management (CRUD operations for documents), user settings, etc.

### Functionalities to Implement

1. **Markdown Editor:**
   - Syntax highlighting for markdown.
   - Auto-save drafts.

2. **Live Preview:**
   - Update HTML preview as the user types markdown.

3. **File Management:**
   - Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for markdown files.
   - Folder organization.

4. **Settings:**
   - Theme selection (light/dark mode).
   - Font size adjustments.
   - Editor preferences (e.g., tab size).

5. **Export/Import:**
   - Export markdown documents as `.md` files.
   - Import existing markdown files.
